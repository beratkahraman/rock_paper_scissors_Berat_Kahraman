# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Project Overview

This project is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It allows a user to play against the computer in multiple rounds, with the first to win two rounds declared the winner.

## Features

- A user-friendly interface that guides the player through the game.
- The game rules are clearly explained at the start.
- The computer makes random choices, providing a fair challenge.
- The game allows the player to quit at any time by typing "exit".
- After each game, the player can choose to play again or end the session.

## How to Play

1. Run the program in your Python environment.
2. The game will ask you to choose between "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".
3. The computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The outcome of each round will be displayed along with the current score.
5. The first to win two rounds wins the game.
6. You can choose to play again or exit the game after each session.

## Code Structure

- The main game logic is encapsulated in the `rock_paper_scissors_Berat_Kahraman()` function.
- The game uses Python's built-in `random` module to simulate the computer's choices.
- Simple conditional statements determine the winner of each round.
